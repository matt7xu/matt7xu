Sometimes I ask myself what is the difference between == and === in javascript? Well, with == I kind of guess, but with === I'm really sure I love coding. I enjoy the process of problem solving. I found learning new things and solving problems satisfying.
At work, I enjoy working as a team. Being positive and supportive to other people.
If I am not in front of my laptop, I am properly busy finding good food in the city.
